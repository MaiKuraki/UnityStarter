# Unity Project Starter Template

This is a lightweight, modular Unity project template designed to provide a solid foundation for your new projects. It integrates core modules inspired by the **Unreal Engine**, including a **Gameplay Framework**, **Gameplay Tags**, and a **Gameplay Ability System**. Additionally, it features a high-performance, low-GC resource, object pool, and audio management system. The project also includes practical Debug tools and supports various **DI/IoC frameworks**. All modules are developed as decoupled **Unity Packages** and are optimized for platforms such as **Android, iOS, and WebGL**.

## 💉 DI / IoC
This template supports multiple Dependency Injection frameworks. You can switch between branches to see dedicated examples for each. The **GameplayFramework** and **Factory** modules contain specific DI implementation samples.

- **DI/IoC framework support** with pre-configured adapters for: (All **listed frameworks have been** tested in production environments.)
  - [VContainer](https://github.com/hadashiA/VContainer)
  - [StrangeIoC](https://github.com/strangeioc/strangeioc)
  - [Extenject(Zenject)](https://github.com/Mathijs-Bakker/Extenject) (no longer actively maintained.)
> Since the author of [**Zenject**](https://github.com/Mathijs-Bakker/Extenject) announced the [discontinuation of project updates](https://github.com/Mathijs-Bakker/Extenject/issues/73), I recommend trying [**VContainer**](https://github.com/hadashiA/VContainer). If you prefer a higher degree of customization for your project, [**StrangeIoC**](https://github.com/strangeioc/strangeioc) is a better choice. If you decide to use [**Zenject**](https://github.com/Mathijs-Bakker/Extenject), [**MessagePipe**](https://github.com/Cysharp/MessagePipe) is a compatible messaging framework that works well with it.

## Project Structure
The main source code for the modules is located in the [`UnityStarter/Assets/ThirdParty/`](./UnityStarter/Assets/ThirdParty/) directory. The project is developed using a Unity Package-based approach with separated Assembly Definitions (asmdef), which allows for easy removal of unwanted modules and ensures a clear separation of concerns.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Unity 2022.3+**

### Using as a Full Project Template
1.  **Clone or download** this repository.
2.  **Locate the Renaming Tool**: Find the `rename_project` executable inside the `Tools/Executable` directory.
3.  **Move the Tool**: Copy the executable to the project root (`UnityStarter/`).
4.  **Run the Tool**: Execute it from the command line. It will guide you through renaming the project folder, company name, and application name across all necessary configuration files.
5.  **Open in Unity**: You can now open the renamed project folder in Unity.

### Using Specific Modules
For existing projects, you can import individual modules:

-   **Simple Method**: Copy the desired package folder from `UnityStarter/Assets/ThirdParty/CycloneGames/` into your project's `Assets` folder.
-   **Recommended Method**: To keep your project clean, move the package folders to a location *outside* your `Assets` directory. Then, in Unity, use the **Package Manager** to **"Add package from disk..."** and select the `package.json` file for each module.

---

## 🚀 Build & CI/CD

This template is designed for automated builds and seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines.

-   **Automated Build Scripts**: The project includes a powerful build script located at `Assets/Editor/BuildScript.cs`. It provides menu items in the Unity Editor for one-click builds for multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, Android, WebGL).

-   **Automatic Versioning**: Builds are automatically versioned using the Git commit count. The version number is formatted as `vX.Y.CommitCount` (e.g., `v0.1.123`), ensuring every build has a unique and traceable version.

-   **Runtime Version Information**: Before each build, the script captures the current Git commit hash, commit count, and build date, and saves this information into a `VersionInfoData` ScriptableObject (`Assets/UnityStarter/Scripts/Build/VersionInfoData.cs`). This allows you to easily display detailed build information within your application for debugging and support purposes.

-   **CI/CD Ready**: The build methods can be triggered from the command line, making it straightforward to integrate with CI/CD systems like Jenkins, TeamCity.
